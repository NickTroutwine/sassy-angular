	This app was built to demonstrate some of the abillities I have learned over the last 2 days. I took your advice and went home and reread angulars documentaton along with Sass's and wanted to show what I learned. This simple app just demonstrates a few of angulars features and how they work. I rewrote some of Sass and Angulars documentation in terms I found a little simpiler.
