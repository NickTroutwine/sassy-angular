<h1>So what makes this Angular so Sassy?</h1>
  <div>
      <h2>Syntastically Awsome Stylesheets is just that, Awsome. </h2>
      <p>So as is everything with Windows you have to jump through a couple hoops to get everything but once you do there is no going back. SASS is truely a gift to the Earth. At first you think psssstttt whoopty dooo nesting css that can't be worth all the hype. But once you play with this compiler for 10 minutes you realize you have been doing CSS wrong this whole time.</p>

      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <p>Basically SASS has some basic properties incorporated from programming languages that dramatically increase how fast and efficiently you can write your stylesheets. Nesting your css makes so much more sense and feels much more natural. This, expecially to someone with strong programming background, will look cleaner and more organized than any other stylesheet you will see.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <p>So no longer will you spend your days going crawling through lines of css to figure out which exact  hexadecimal you used 200 lines ago. With SASS you can now save that bad boy in a clever variable and use it anytime you need it. This comes to be cherished expecially when writing out like background-image: url('http://sass-lang.com/assets/img/logos/logo-b6e1ef6e.svg');. All you would have to do is write $peskyUrl: background-image: url('http://sass-lang.com/assets/img/logos/logo-b6e1ef6e.svg'); and never worry about writing it out agian.
  </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Compile</h2>
      <p>So we got this awsome Sass file that we poured are heart and soul into but how does that turn into css? Well thats the easy part! All you have to do is in your terminal watch your SASS file and specify where it compiles too. Then Boom you are done and ready to go. </p>
